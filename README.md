## Ð¡ondition of the problem
Develop a decision-making programme based on the usefulness of each decision. The programme accepts the user's assessment (from worst to best) as input, after which it considers a simple case where the user chooses where to go under certain natural conditions (in this case, rain/sun). Next, the user enters an assessment of their feelings depending on the location and natural conditions. The programme outputs the usefulness for each location and the recommended decision.
